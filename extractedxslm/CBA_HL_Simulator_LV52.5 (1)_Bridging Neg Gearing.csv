2,2,Negatively Geared Investment Loans,
3,2,"Refer to the Postcode Lookup Tool for geographic negative gearing eligibility. 
Note: Negative Gearing calculates the interest and monthly charges to be paid on an investment home loan each year and uses this figure as a tax deduction.  Therefore the applicant(s) taxable income will be less, which means that the tax paid by the applicant(s) will be less.
Negative gearing is not applicable in the servicing of IHL applications with a Base LVR greater than 90% or for customers receiving the First Home Buyers' grant. Please add in the Ongoing Loan splits (if applicable for Negative Gearing) under 'Bridging Period' tab, to accomodate for the Negative Gearing eligibility during the Bridging Period
